Why, hello.

I'm just a freshman CS major at UMD.
I don't know much about anything, but through my efforts I'm hoping that'll change very quickly. 
The guava is a spectacular fruit requires a very high IQ to eat. Basically, its a fruit only Rick and Morty fans can comprehend.
Which is why I don't eat guava.
